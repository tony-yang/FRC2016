# FRC2016 Stronghold

This is a demo of using the RobotBuilder tool provided by FRC to generate the C++ robot code from scratch based on modular components of a Robot.


## RobotBuilder Guide

The RobotBuilder guide can be found: https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/26402

RobotBuilder is part of the standard WPILib Eclipse Plugin. After installing the Eclipse plugin, the tool can be found under ~/wpilib/tools by default.


## Robot YAML Definition

The Yaml file <PROJECT_NAME>.yaml is the source of truth for the generated robot code. Load the yaml into the RobotBuilder to see all the components and how they are linked.
